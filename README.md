# Setup steps - before the bootcamp

**Estimated time: 30 minutes**

1. Clone this repository to your laptop:  `git clone https://github.com/infiniaml/ml-bootcamp-2018`
2. Install Anaconda - see [TensorFlow_Installation.pdf](https://github.com/infiniaml/ml-bootcamp-2018/blob/master/TensorFlow_Installation.pdf) for OS-specific instructions.
    - *You can skip the steps for installing TensorFlow, which is more easily done in step 3.*
3. Create the Python environment by opening a terminal and running `conda env create` while your terminal is this directory. This will download and install the dependencies specified in environment.yml.
4. Activate the Python environment by running `source activate tensorflow` (or just `activate tensorflow` on Windows).
    - *Important: you must always activate the "tensorflow" environment in your terminal, to ensure the correct environment and dependencies are being used by subsequent commands.*
5. Launch the Jupyter notebook server by running `jupyter notebook`. This should open a web browser window at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).
6. Click the "Bootcamp.ipynb" notebook file to open it.
7. Run all the commands in cells 1, 2, 3, and 4. To run a single cell, select it with your mouse and click the "play" / "run" button.
    - *If you encounter any issues with these setup instructions, please create a GitHub issue with helpful notes and we'll be happy to assist.*
8. Come to the bootcamp! We look forward to meeting you.
